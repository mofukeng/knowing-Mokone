#	My future: **The good parts**

when I am successful in my career, I definitely want to better my life.   
I was never _poor_, and my parents made sure I had everything I wanted but as a man, there is so much that I want to do for myself, my family and my community.
I want a lovely home, I want to get married and have a big family, I want to travel the world.
I also want to mentor kids in my community, teach them more about the tech space because the opportunities are endless. 
I just want to be a better man, for myself, my community and my family and friends.
