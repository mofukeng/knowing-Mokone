# Why I think I will be successful as a coder
I just never give up. 
I know this is my purpose and what I was destined to do so I will never stop until I get it right.
Apart from that, i believe that coding is something children in townships should have access to and i want to make that possible.
I am good with maths and I am a critical and an analytical thinker.
I think very fast before I act. I may have played a lot in the past and a lot of opportunities may have missed me because I was not serious enough.
But I now, I know I am meant to do great things as a coder. I am very persistent, and I like to fight, a good fight of course.
I do ask a lot of questions and I like solving problems. When I plan something, I definitely make sure it happens, no matter what.
Thatâ€™s just a few reasons why I think I will be a successful coder.
