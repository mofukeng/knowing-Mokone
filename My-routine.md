## My routine 
My routine is pretty simple:
*	First thing I do in the moring is wake up and drink a tall glass of water

*	Clean my living space

*	I get ready for the gym at that time and leave the house.

   * By 07:00 am I am at the gym and I will be there for 2 or 3 hours. 
   * I gym, shower after and then I head home.

*	When I get home, itâ€™s around 10:00 am, 
   * I have breakfast.

   * catch up with loved ones 
   * check my WhatsApp messages.

* After that, I start coding and that can go on for the entire day.

*	I make sure I take breaks in between to eat and stretch.
   * Then when I feel like I have accomplished all I want for the day; I watch a movie or two.
