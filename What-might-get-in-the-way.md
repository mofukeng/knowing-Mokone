# What I think might hinder me from success

I am one of those people who work very well under pressure, so I tend to procrastinate.
I also do not like to speak up when I am not coping. I prefer to suffer in silence, but lockdown has taught me you can never be on your own (**_even though we supposed to be alone_**). 
You need people and so I am working on speaking out more and collaborating with people more. 
I sometimes suck at time management, I spend a lot of time on things, without even noticing. 
I once spent 5 hours straight at the gym, My girlfriend was so mad at me, and it was not intentional but when i set my mind to something, i put everything i have on it.
I just got lost in the moment and lost track of time. So yeah, managing time is difficult for me. I spend way too much time on things and that 
is not a good thing when you have deadlines. That is one of the things I want to change, as I enter the job market. 
Mostly i have trouble understanding things on my own, i prefere being tought something rather then reading it on my own. 
The best way is to talk to people about what i am learning so i can grasp more quickier.
