## My future: The scary parts 
If my career in tech does not turn out as great as I hope it would be, I would probably become an entrepreneur or salesperson.
I can sell **anything**, and I would do that to survive.
It wonâ€™t be as fulfilling for me; it might not be inspiring for those that look up to me in my community, but it will put food on the table and that is not bad.
_Growing up is tough man!_
