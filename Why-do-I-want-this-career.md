## Why I want this career
I have always wanted to have a career in the tech space.
I remember I had a computer when I was younger and the thing just stopped working, out of the blue! 
I was so frustrated because I love my computer so much, I played games and watched movies on it.
How could it let me down when I was so broke?
I had to start thinking of a way to solve this problem because getting my parents to buy me a new computer was **impossible**.
I asked a good friend of mine that was working at an internet café at the time to assist me.
He told me what he thought the problem was and how I could fix it. I then went home to _“fix”_ my computer.
Long story short, the computer never came back to life again. It died, instantly! _LOL_. 
>"Me attempting to fix my computer evoked something in me."

I wanted more of the tech space, I looked at emerging technologies like **AI**, **Machine Learning**, and I knew this is what I wanted to do.
Fast forward, I made it to the **uMuzi Bootcamp**. I am grateful and so proud of myself for making it thus far.
