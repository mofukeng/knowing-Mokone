# My current commitments
The only financial commitment i have is my gym fee.
My current commitments are this bootcamp.
I am not employed, and I just finished school.
I _eat_, _drink_ and _sleep_ **Umuzi Bootcamp**, okay the last part is a lie, I can never eat bootcamp, I need real food _lol_.
I have dedicated all my time for the bootcamp, and I will dedicate all my time for a full time learnership when I am successful.
There is nothing I want more than this and I am determined to work very hard to ensure that I am successful.
**Thanks for the opportunity once again.**
