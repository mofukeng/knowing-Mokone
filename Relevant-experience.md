# Relevant experience
I have done some exciting projects while I was in school.
I have also done some cool exciting ones in my free time. 
I tend to make the internet my friend on most occasions, not a real friend, but you get what I mean right? Okay.
It is amazing how much a person can learn if they just dedicate an hour, every day.
I taught myself how to code just by watching [YouTube](www.youtube.com) videos and I believe I could do more if I commit myself.
