### My History

I am **Lesedi Mokone Masitha**.
I was born and bred in Johannesburg and I have lived here all my life.
I have family that I love in the Free State and I like to visit them because that is where my roots are. 
I am very cultural, and I believe I would not be where I am if it was not for my ancestors and family. **They mean so much to me.**
I attended school in the East, Edenvale to be precise, **_and whoa, it was bad_**. I used to be such a bad boy; I never took anything seriously.
I was just living, care-free.
Sometimes I feel like I should have done things differently back then, maybe I would be very far in life.
But everything happens for a reason, I had to go through everything that I went through to be the kind of man I am  today.
I am so grate for every negative and positive thing in my life, it helps shape who I am destined to be.
I am so grateful to God that I realised what was important in life quick and I made changes to the life I was living.
I look forward to the future and the name I will make for myself in the industry.
