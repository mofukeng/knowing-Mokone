## What I like to do in my free time 
Do I have free time? No. My girlfriend takes all of my time.
I am just kidding, don’t tell her I said this, she’ll kill me. Well I like doing a lot of things in my free time, namely: 

•	Going to the gym, (_leg day is my favourite_) 

•	Watching movies (_netflix and chill_) to be precise

•	Spending time with the boys (_having a beer, or two or six_)

•	Coding (_there are so many free resources online and I make sure I take advantage of that, i must admit git is the most challenging_)

•	Cooking (_my girlfriend likes to call me a chef_)

•	Playing with my dog 

•	Reading (**_sometimes even though i would like to do it more offten_**)

That’s all I can think of for now, I will let you know when I add more to that list, **_lol_**.
